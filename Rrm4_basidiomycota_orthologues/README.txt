Rrm4_basidiomycota_orthologues
Contains a list of all basidiomycota Rrm4 orthologue sequences found in Blastp, OMA and FungiDB.
Sequences are organised by class and relative relatedness. 

Rrm4_basidiomycota_orthologues_alignment_sequences_only
Full sequences of Rrm4 basidiomycota orthologues selected for alignment.
2 sequences per class are selected (unless there is only 1 sequence for a particular class).

Rrm4_basidiomycota_orthologues_fullseqs_mafft_alignment_cleaned
Aligned basidiomycota sequences, generated by a MAFFT alignment with default settings.
Headers are reduced to only include gene and species name.

Rrm4_basidiomycota_orthologues_alignment_tree_species_name_only
Phylogenetic tree in Phylo.io (generated by MAFFT) for the aligned basidiomycota orthologues.
